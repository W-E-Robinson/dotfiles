# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile for configuring Vim and scripting to set it up.

## Configurations
- **.vimrc**: Configuration file for Vim editor settings.

Each configuration comes with a dedicated directory at the top level of the repository. Inside each directory, you'll find the respective dotfile alongside a README.md file if additional information is required.

## Installation
To set up these configurations on your system, follow the following method:

### Use locally installed Node:
1. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm i
    ```

2. Run npm configuration script:

    ```sh
    npm run configure
    ```

The installation process will prompt you for any necessary actions.
